               <p>My morning routine can make or break the rest of my day, so I’ve developed a little &quot;morning routine checklist&quot; that helps me get organized and be more productive!</p>
               <p>I’ve been on a little habits kick lately. I feel like the older I get, the more I’m realizing how much my habits determine how I spend my time and whether or not I achieve my goals. And one of the most important sets of habits that affects how my day plays out is my morning routine.</p>
               <p>If I’m a mess in the morning, I feel like I spend the rest of the day trying to catch up. If I am able to be intentional about my mornings, though, the rest of my day tends to go more smoothly as well.</p>
               <p>Because of this, I’ve developed a little “morning routine checklist” to help me stay on track. Everyone will have a different morning routine that works for them, their circumstances, and their stage of life, but I thought I’d share what’s working for me these days– I know I’m always interested to know what’s working for other people!</p>

               <h3>Keep my phone somewhere other than on my nightstand</h3>
               <p>I realized a while ago that having my phone plugged in right beside the bed on my nightstand was way too big of a temptation for me. I would end up staying up later browsing social media aimlessly, and the first thing I would do in the morning was grab my phone and start browsing aimlessly again… not the best way to start or end my day. To break this habit, I began plugging in my phone somewhere other than by my bed.</p>

               <h3>Set a positive focus from the start</h3>
               <p>When my alarm goes off, I quickly put on my workout clothes. Before I actually work out, though, I sit in my cozy chair and start out my day by setting a positive focus. For me this means writing in my journal, and meditating before I do anything else. When I do this first thing, it doesn’t mean that I automatically have a perfect day, but I do feel like I am better equipped to handle whatever may come my way that day.</p>

            <div>
               <h3>Get moving</h3>
               <p>Next I do some sort of short workout using the big, open space in our living room. Right now I am loving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WorldClassClubs">World Class on Youtube</a> because it gives me access to a bunch of different workouts right on my big TV. My favorites are EXPRESS L.A.B and Streaching.</p>

               <h3>Feed my brain</h3>
               <p>Often if I’m doing a workout that I’m pretty familiar with, I’ll often listen to an audiobook or podcast at the same time. (I love <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-testing-show/id1094861077">The testing show podcast</a>, and right now I’m listening to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/B0006IU4C0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1516816790&sr=8-3&keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people&linkCode=sl1&tag=justagirlabby-20&linkId=38a758ec02c9d9201c3c6d9cb89d61cf">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> on Audible). This helps me multi-task a little bit and work out + learn something new at the same time!</p>

               <h3>Feed my belly</h3>
               <p>After I’m done working out, I head to the kitchen to make breakfast. I am a creature of habit, so I typically have the same things each day: a glass of celery juice and an avocado toast. Breakfast time also gives me a few minutes to chat with my husband before we head our separate ways for the day.</p>

               <h3>Attach a new habit to an existing habit that’s already formed</h3>
               <p>This was a little trick I learned recently that has helped me remember to take my vitamins, of all things! I was always forgetting them, so I needed a way to make sure I took them every single day. Since I was already consistently making myself a cup of tea, I simply put my vitamins in the drawer with my tea collection to automatically remind me to take them while I was making my tea. It has worked like a charm ever since!</p>

               <h3>Have the tools I need to get ready for the day organized and ready to go</h3>
               <p>After we finish breakfast, I head upstairs to grab a shower and get ready for the day. This process goes a lot more smoothly if my makeup and hair tools are organized and easy to find.</p>
               <p>My little makeup station in my closet is still working really well for me, and I keep my vanity drawers organized so I can find everything I need to get ready.</p>

               <p>Now, does this routine happen perfectly every single day? Nope. But if I slack off or get out of the routine, I give myself grace and restart the next day. My morning routine has also changed and evolved over time. It’s a process that I'm always examining and working on getting better at in order to create smooth mornings!</p>
